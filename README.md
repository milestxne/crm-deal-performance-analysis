# CRM Deal Performance Analysis and Visualization
# Introduction
This project involves analyzing a CRM dataset to gain valuable insights into the performance of sales deals. The dataset includes key fields such as sales_agent, deal_status, product, close_value, and account. By focusing on deals that were either won or lost (excluding deals in progress), the project provides actionable insights into sales performance and deal trends.

Using Python's SQLite library for data transformation and SQL queries to manipulate and filter the dataset, I prepared the data for visualization in Tableau. The goal was to create a clear, interactive “Deal Performance” dashboard that allows both technical and non-technical users to explore and understand key sales metrics.

The interactive dashboard highlights the relationships between sales agents, product performance, deal closure rates, and trends over time, answering many quesstions concerning the dataset to help businesses make data-driven decisions about sales strategies, training, and product focus. Some of these questions/KPIs are:
# Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) :
- Performance by Sales Agent ✅

Conversion Rates: Calculate the conversion rate for each sales agent by determining how many deals they close compared to the number of leads they handle.

Average Close Value: Determine the average close value per closed deal for each sales agent to assess their contribution to overall revenue.
- Product Performance ✅

Product Popularity: Identify which products are most frequently involved in deals, analyzing both deal count and total close value to assess their performance.

Product Success Rate: Calculate the conversion rates for different products to determine which products close more successfully.

- Correlation Analysis ✅

Product and Sales Agent Match: Investigate whether certain sales agents perform better with specific products, which could inform targeted sales strategies, training, or team structuring.

- Trend Analysis Over Time ✅

Deal Performance Over Time: Analyze trends in deal performance (won vs. lost) over time to identify any seasonal or cyclical patterns in the dataset.

Sales Agent Performance Trends: Track the performance of sales agents over different time periods (monthly) to evaluate consistency and improvements in sales activities.
